	<h2 class="headingskin"> 1. Over-Exfoliating </h2>
	<p class="blogpara"> Exfoliating is amazing for your skin; it removes dead skin cells that clog your pores and lead to blackheads and pimples! 
But there is such a thing as over-exfoliating – done too vigorously, you can end up scratching the surface of your skin’s protective barrier, 
leaving it open to infection and exposed to environmental toxins. So, finding the right balance is key.To make sure you don’t over exfoliate, 
avoid applying too much pressure and use an exfoliator with gentle, small granules, which won’t be too abrasive on your skin. 
If you have dry or sensitive skin, we recommend exfoliating once a week, for normal and combo skin, twice a week, and for oily and combination skin up to three times a week. </p>
	<h2 class="headingskin">2. Popping, Picking and Rubbing </h2>
	<p class="blogpara">Our skin does such an amazing job of protecting us, that sometimes we forget how fragile it is and how careful we need to be with it.
 We all know we shouldn’t pick at our skin, but the truth is when we get a giant zit, most of us just can’t help squeezing it. 
But the more you push and pick at your zit, the more inflammation you create underneath. Not to mention, all the bacteria from your fingertips 
is now all over your skin, and it’s now going to penetrate that hole you just made on your face, making it more likely for the pimple to come back, possibly even more inflamed than before.</p>

<h2 class="headingskin">3. Not Protecting Your Skin </h2>
	<p class="blogpara">Okay, so you probably know you’re meant to wear sunscreen daily, but do you know why? 
If you don’t, chances are you probably don’t bother with SPF, but we’re here to tell you why it’s SO essential! 
The sun is responsible for 90% of how your skin ages – yes, genetics play a part, but so does sunblock!</p>

<h2 class="headingskin">4. Forgetting About Your Neck and Eyes</h2>
	<p class="blogpara">If you’ve read our five skincare rules, you’ll know exactly how to take care of your face, but what people so often neglect is their eye cream and continuing their routine down their neck. Crow’s feet and a neck are some of the most obvious signs of aging, so even if your face is looking flawless, if you’ve forgotten about your neck, it will be a serious giveaway of your age. Continue your entire skincare regime down your neck; this means double cleansing your neck as well – we often add bronzer here to make sure we don’t have any foundation lines – toning, and moisturizing. Make sure you’re gentle and massage in upward motions so that you’re not pulling the skin downward, which is precisely where you don’t want your skin to go!

The skin under our eyes is the most delicate on our entire bodies and needs plenty of hydration and nourishment, not just to prevent fine lines,  but to help get rid of dark circles and puffiness.</p>

<h2 class="headingskin">5. Using the Same Products Forever </h2>
	<p class="blogpara">You may have found a moisturizer that is THE DREAM, but sadly, it’s a love affair that can’t last forever. 
Eventually, your skin will change and adapt to any active ingredients in your product, so that over time, they become less effective. 
Not to mention your skin changes, so what worked for it a year or two ago, might no longer be the right product. 
It’s important to know your skin type and constantly reevaluate your skin (every six months) because there are so many things that can affect it; 
from your hormones and environment to your stress-levels and age.</p>
