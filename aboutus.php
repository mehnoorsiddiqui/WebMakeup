        <h2 class="aboutheading">The future </h2>
        <p class="aboutpara"> “As a brand, we are fun yet sophisticated, and we are always innovating! Any time we
            create a new product, we raise the bar and make sure that whatever we are creating will fill
            a gap in the industry. We want every product to serve a purpose; if there isn’t a need for something or
            there is already an amazing product available, then we won’t create a new one.
            I’m not motivated by money, so the bottom line doesn’t matter to me. It is about giving people the power to
            them express who they want to be no matter who they are, or where they are from.
            Beauty is not about how much you spend, but how confident you feel, so that will always be the ultimate goal
            for us.”</p>
